references reset css (eric myer), to zero out styles applied by browser. Goes at top of stylesheet or first referenced file

## Principle: allow users to set their own font size

### css
css_1_fontPc.css - base + percentage model. start 'small' size in base. then size other elements fonts accordingly, as %

* users change font sizes for acessibility and readability

Alternative:

* Ems. size relative to parent class
* Rems. size relative to base class - probaby best approach now, expect most/all browsers to support rems
